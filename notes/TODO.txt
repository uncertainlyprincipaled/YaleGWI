# YaleGWI Project TODO - Updated After Preprocessing Fixes

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED (Latest Update)

### ✅ Preprocessing Pipeline Fixed
- **Issue**: `boolean index did not match indexed array along axis 3; size of axis is 70 but size of corresponding boolean axis is 501`
- **Root Cause**: Data shape mismatch in `validate_nyquist` function - S3 data has different dimensions than expected
- **Solution**: 
  - Made `validate_nyquist` function robust to handle different data shapes
  - Fixed `preprocess_one` to dynamically determine time axis
  - Updated `create_zarr_dataset` to handle actual S3 data structures
  - Added comprehensive error handling and fallbacks
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED - Ready for testing

### ✅ Test Infrastructure Created
- Created `tests/test_preprocess_fix.py` to verify fixes work
- Moved test files from `src/core/` to `tests/` directory
- Created `tests/run_tests.py` for comprehensive testing
- **NEW**: Integrated testing into `colab_setup.py` for automatic validation
- **NEW**: Created `colab_test_setup.py` for standalone testing in Colab

### ✅ Complete Testing Solution
- **Integrated Testing**: `colab_setup.py` now includes `run_tests_and_validation()` function
- **Standalone Testing**: `colab_test_setup.py` can be run independently in Colab
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests preprocessing fixes, Phase 1 components, and integration
- **Automatic Validation**: Tests run automatically during setup with detailed reporting
