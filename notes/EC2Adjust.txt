I'll help you understand the AWS training workflow and analyze the codebase. Let me break this down into parts.
Introduction to AWS Concepts and Workflow
The basic workflow for training on EC2 involves several key components:
a) S3 (Simple Storage Service):
Acts as persistent storage for your data and model artifacts
In your case, the yale-gwi bucket stores:
Raw data in the raw/ prefix
Model checkpoints in checkpoints/
Training logs in logs/
b) EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):
Provides virtual servers for computation
Your setup uses:
Instance type: g5.2xlarge (GPU-enabled instance)
Spot instances for cost savings
200GB GP3 EBS volume for storage
Ubuntu AMI (ami-0dfae3c90574ae005)
c) Shell Scripting Workflow:
Your setup uses three main scripts:
launch_aws.sh: Launches the EC2 instance
bootstrap_aws.sh: Sets up the instance environment
cleanup_aws.sh: Manages cleanup and instance termination
Remote Debugging Workflow
The key differences between Kaggle and EC2 debugging are:
a) Access Methods:
Kaggle: Web-based notebook interface
EC2: SSH access for direct terminal interaction
b) Debugging Approaches:
Logging: Your code already has good logging setup in probe_s3_bucket.py
Remote Monitoring:
SSH into the instance: ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@$PUBLIC_IP
Monitor logs: tail -f /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
Check GPU status: nvidia-smi
Codebase Analysis
Let me analyze the codebase for potential adjustments:
Based on my analysis of the codebase, here are the key findings and recommendations for running AWS training overnight:
Code Adjustments Needed:
a) Environment Detection:
The code already has good environment detection in Config class
AWS-specific settings are properly handled in SpotInstanceHandler
b) Memory Management:
The code has robust memory management with:
Mixed precision training (AMP)
Gradient checkpointing
Memory-efficient attention
GPU memory fraction limiting (80%)
c) Checkpointing:
The SpotInstanceHandler class handles spot instance interruptions
Checkpoints are saved both locally and to S3
Metadata is saved alongside checkpoints
Workflow for Running Training:
a) Launch Instance:
Apply to EC2Adjust.tx...
Run
# 1. Set up AWS credentials
source .env/aws/credentials

# 2. Launch instance
./scripts/launch_aws.sh
b) Monitor Training:
SSH into the instance using the provided command
Monitor logs: tail -f /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
Check GPU status: nvidia-smi
c) Cleanup:
Apply to EC2Adjust.tx...
Run
# When training is complete
./scripts/cleanup_aws.sh
Debugging Workflow:
a) Remote Access:
SSH into the instance
Use tmux or screen for persistent sessions
Monitor logs in real-time
b) Common Issues and Solutions:
Out of Memory (OOM):
Code already handles OOM with graceful recovery
Reduces batch size automatically
Clears GPU cache periodically
Spot Instance Interruption:
SpotInstanceHandler saves checkpoints
Training can resume from last checkpoint
Data Loading Issues:
Use probe_s3_bucket.py to verify data access
Check S3 permissions and connectivity
Training Monitoring:
Monitor validation metrics
Check for NaN/Inf values
Track GPU memory usage
The codebase is well-prepared for AWS training with:
Robust error handling
Automatic checkpointing
Memory optimization
Spot instance support
S3 integration
No major adjustments are needed to make the script work on AWS. The existing code already handles the transition from Kaggle to AWS environment through the Config class and environment detection.
Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or provide more specific details about any part of the workflow?
