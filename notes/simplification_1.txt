Topic: Simplifying functionality for better results; understand leaderboard models and use there strategies to simplify/improve my code. , Discussion: I am having trouble running any sort of code with my own code. Something about loading it into memory too much one time seems to make all subsequent sessions hang. However when running the attached notebook "notes/HGNet-V2Starter.py" and "ConvNeXtBaseline.py" I don't have such loading problems. , Tasks: 1. Analyze my current as summarized by kaggle_notebook.py, README.md, refactor_1.txt, genesis.txt. 2. Analyze the notebooks "notes/HGNet-V2Starter.py" and "ConvNeXtBaseline.py". Summarize there approach to the competition, and try and discuss/define/contextualize all the techniques they use. Real try and explain yourself thoroughly and emphasize common patterns you see being using. 2.5. The notebooks use the # %% in front of some cells. Is this indicative of programmatic insertion or am I missing something. 3. Theorize as to the why behind the "hangtime" issues. And investigate ways we can simplify the code to get a workable notebook/submission. For each possible change note the relevant block of kaggle_notebook.py. Kaggle_notebook.py is compiled from files from a directory src.core and src.utils, and I will want my IDE to apply changes to each of these specific files. 4. Organize proposed changes by blocks, in a hierarchical prompt. This prompt is intended to prompt Cursor IDE to iteratively apply the changes until totally implemented.

Below is a three-part response:

What your current code is doing (and why it can stall).

What the two leaderboard notebooks do differently (common winning patterns you can borrow).

A Cursor-ready hierarchical prompt that makes the minimum set of edits‚Äîgrouped by file/block‚Äîto get you an MVP that loads fast and trains reliably.

1‚ÄÇQuick map of your code & likely ‚Äúhang-time‚Äù causes
Layer	Purpose	Heavy bits	Where in kaggle_notebook.py
SeismicDataset	mmap + z-score normalise every receiver each time	‚Ä¢ Casts to float32 ‚Üí doubles RAM vs float16
‚Ä¢ Persistent workers keep the file handles open	lines 1 ‚Äì 90 
PhysMask + SpecProj-UNet	FFT split ‚Üí duplicate channels (√ó5) ‚Üí two UNets	‚Ä¢ repeat(1, 5, ‚Ä¶, ‚Ä¶) increases GPU RAM 5√ó
‚Ä¢ Forward pass returns B√óS UNet calls ‚Üí high peak mem	model block starting around line 1200 
Training loop	vanilla FP32 training	‚Ä¢ No AMP / FP16
‚Ä¢ No torch.cuda.empty_cache() between epochs	training block lines 1500 ‚Äì 1560 
Update watcher	regenerates notebook on every file touch	‚Ä¢ When imported inside a notebook the watcher thread can survive kernel restarts and hold locks	described in README automatic-update section 

Why sessions hang

After one heavy run the CUDA context and the file-watcher thread stay alive; a new kernel tries to re-import everything and contends for GPU memory + file locks, so the first call to torch.rand‚Ä¶ just waits.

The 5√ó channel duplication in SpecProjUNet.forward often tips a free T4 over its 16 GB limit; if the OOM happens inside a dataloader worker the kernel may freeze instead of throwing.

2‚ÄÇWhat the public-LB notebooks do that keeps them snappy
Notebook	Key tricks	Where shown
HGNet-V2 Starter	Pre-compute a (70√ó70) float16 version of every cube ‚Üí 25√ó smaller; trains with AMP + EMA + DDP; uses timm pretrained encoder-decoder so the first conv already expects 5 channels (no manual repeat)	see preprocessing helper & SimpleNamespace config 
ConvNeXt Baseline	Same pipeline but keeps full resolution; swaps BatchNorm ‚Üí InstanceNorm; warns about NaNs in pure FP16 so uses BF16/FP32; again timm backbone and EMA; flip TTA at inference	cfg + dataset code 
, data loader augments 

Common winning patterns

Float16 / BF16 everywhere (dataset and model) ‚Üí 2√ó RAM headroom.

Pre-encoded backbones so no channel duplication.

DDP + larger batch to hide I/O.

EMA & simple flip TTA for an easy 2-pt MAE boost.

Jupytext cell markers # %% ‚Äì these just mark notebook cells when a .py file is exported; not programmatic, safe to ignore.

‚îÇ    ‚óè ds-02 ‚Üí expose CLI arg `--num_workers` in make_loader; default = 2 and

‚îÇ      Wrap forward/backward with `torch.cuda.amp.autocast(enabled=args.fp16)`

     ‚óè watch-off ‚Üí guard the watcher with

     so it is **disabled by default** in Kaggle.
How this fixes the hangs

Dataset now streams fp16 tensors, halving GPU footprint.

Channel-duplication is gone; first conv does the expansion at no extra RAM.

AMP + empty_cache() prevents residue allocations between epochs.

File-watcher no longer spawns background threads unless you opt-in.

Apply this, restart the notebook once, and you should be able to:

bash
Copy
Edit
python src/core/train.py --dryrun --fp16 1 --num_workers 2
without the kernel freezing. From there you can incrementally fold in the HGNet-style EMA, flip-TTA, and DDP once the basic loop is stable.
